Exercise 10

1)How many Address Book Entries are listed as born before February 12th of 1982?

2)How many Address Book Entries are listed as born on or after January 1st of 1965?

3)Which Address Book Entry is listed as being the oldest of age?

Answer:
1) > SELECT id
    -> FROM Entry
    -> WHERE birthday < '1982-02-12';
2) > SELECT id
    -> FROM Entry
    -> WHERE birthday >= '1965-01-01';
3) SELECT * FROM Entry ORDER BY birthday LIMIT 1; // when we type 'LIMIT 1', it will give the first result which is the oldest. and if we type 'LIMIT 10', it will give the first 10 results
